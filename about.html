                <p>Actually, I really want to be a game developer. There's something magical about creating entire worlds, characters, and stories that people can 
                actually step into and experience.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, game development isn't really in demand in my country. The industry here is small, 
                and opportunities are limited. So instead of giving up on my dream completely, I chose a different path, web development. It's still coding, still creative, 
                and honestly? It hooks me in the same way games do.</p>
                <p>I love the problem-solving, the design challenges, and that feeling when something finally works 
                after hours of debugging. Plus, with web development, I can build interactive experiences too—just 
                in a browser instead of a game engine. Who knows? Maybe one day I'll combine both and build 
                browser-based games!</p>

                <p>So bear with my designs as I learn. Every great developer started somewhere, and this is my 
                starting line. 頑張ります! (I'll do my best!)</p>
